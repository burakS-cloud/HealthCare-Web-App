# HealthCare-Web-App
Hospital web application that user, doctor and secretary user types that can seperately authenticate and can do different operations based on their user type and authorization.
Currently under development, the authentication system works for different schema models, sending post request through the form located on the homepage to create appointments as user is the feature i'm currently working on. This is an on going project for my graduation project-I.
