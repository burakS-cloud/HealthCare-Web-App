# HealthCare-Web-App
Hospital web application that user, doctor and secretary user types that can seperately authenticate and can do different operations based on their user type and authorization.
Currently under development, the authentication system works for different schema models, sending post request through the form located on the homepage to create appointments as user is the feature i'm currently working on. This is an on going project for my graduation project-I.
To run the project on your machine, make sure you have node.js and mongoDB installed & configured ( add path environment variable ). Then all you have to do is run 'npm install' command in the terminal, it will download all the dependencies needed.
